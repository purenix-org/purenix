# PureNix Organization Members

This document lays out guidelines for members of the [`purenix-org`](https://github.com/purenix-org) GitHub Organization.
If you get added to `purenix-org`, please read through it.

1. Since PureNix is a new ecosystem, not attracting users and contributors is much more dangerous than poor decision-making.
   We value moving things forward over excessive bike-shedding.
   Changes that turn out to be bad can always be rolled back.

   There may come a time to make these guidelines more conservative, but that is certainly not now.

2. As an `purenix-org` member, we fully trust your ability to improve the PureNix ecosystem.
   You are free to change as little or as much as you see fit, including big changes like creating new repositories, or re-organizing existing libraries.
   You don't necessarily need to ask for permission, but of course, creating an issue or opening a proof-of-concept PR to discuss things beforehand is always welcome!

3. Please be proactive in giving out the commit bit to people who seem interested in improving the PureNix ecosystem.
   If you do, please show them this page.

4. We generally want changes to come in through PRs, not to be committed directly to the master branch.
   If you haven't gotten any feedback to your PR in a week or so, feel free to re-ping the other maintainers, or just merge the PR in yourself.

5. We appreciate documentation, ideally comments in the code, or alternatively markdown files in the repo.
   If neither of those make sense, then an explanation in an issue or PR is also helpful.
